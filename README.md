# A Snake Clone writen in Go

## Author : Nikos Gournakis

## Running 

### Linux
Just running `build.sh` and executing the file will work!
```bash
./build.sh clean && out/snake_clone
```
### Cross-compiling for Windows (with WSL)
```bash
./build.sh windows release
```

This is my preferred way of building, as it's how my enviroment is set up
### Windows
